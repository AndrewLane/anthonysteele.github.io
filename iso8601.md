# ISO8601 or GTFO

When sending date-time data between systems, your options fall into two categories:
 
 1. [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) with an explicit timezone, or 
 2. A world of pain.
 
## ISO8601

```json
{
  "OrderDue": "2017-04-05T14:30Z"
}
```

ISO8601 is a format where all parts of the date or datetime are laid out in a structured way, largest to smallest. It is human readable and can be unambiguously parsed by code.

It is also logical: When measuring duration, would you say "seven hours, three days and fifteen minutes"? Of course not, the order largest to smallest makes the most logical sense: "three days, seven hours and fifteen minutes". When measuring distance, would you say "2 foot, three yards and an inch"? Of course not, and not just because you should use the metric system.

Read [the specification](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm) or even just [the excellent wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), there is a lot more to it.

## Other options

### UK or US date format

Unless you like differences in functionality between different machines with different system settings, code that works for the first 12 days of the month only, and stored values that you can't even tell if they are correct or if days and months were swapped on input; in short, _a world of pain_, avoid these formats for data interchange.
 

### Epoch seconds.

[Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time) is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

May be fine for sysadmin uses or e.g. timestamping log entries but are not suitable for recording most business date and time values because:

- Are not human readable. Don't underestimate this. Many bugs are caught because anyone can see that the value is wrong. This won't happen with epoch dates.

- Does not store time zone info at all. 10AM in London coincides with 11AM in Paris, but there are cases when the difference is significant. 

- Are implicitly UTC. But did you know that before today? There is high probability that someone can get this wrong when generating a value, or when reading it.  Explicit, human-readable timezone is better.


- Are always the same precision. What if you want to express "it happened on the 12th of Feb, 2017, all day" - in ISO8601 this is `2017-02-12`, but in epoch date you have to specify the time of day as well. Probably you'll use an implicit convention that midnight at the start of day stands in for the whole day, right? Midnight in UTC or in your local time zone? 

Now you have implicit rules that someone will get wrong, and you can't store both "just the date" and "actual precise midnight value". A timezone issue one hour backwards is likely to push the value not just to the wrong hour but to the wrong day. The worst case is that you run into this kind of bug when the clocks change, up to six months later.

The common theme is that there are many implicit decisions and ways to miscommunicate wrapped up in the single integer value of the epoch date, which is what some people refer to as a "bug farm".
