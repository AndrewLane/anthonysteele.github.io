# ISO6601 or GTFO

When sending date-time data between systems, your options are 
 1. [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) with an explicit timezone, or 
 2. A world of pain.

## Other options
 

### Epoch seconds.

[Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time) is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

May be fine for sysadmin uses or e.g. timestamping log entries but are not suitable for recording most business date and time values because:

- Are not human readable.

- Does not store time zone info at all. 10AM in London coincides with 11AM in Paris, but there are cases when the difference is significant. 

- Are implicitly UTC. But did you know that before today? There is high probability that someone can get this wrong when generating a value, or when reading it.  Explicit, human-readable TZ is better.


- Are always the same precision. What if you want to express "it happened on the 12th of Feb, 2017, all day" - in ISO8601 this is `2017-02-12`, but in epoch date you have to specify the time of day as well. Probably you'll use an implicit convention that midnight at the start of day stands in for the whole day, right? Now you have an implicit rule that someone will get wrong, and you can't store both "just the date" and "actual precise midnight value". And a timezone issue one hour backwards is likely to push the value not just to the wrong hour but to the wrong day.


### UK or US date format

- unless you like differences in functionality between different machines with different system settings, code that works for the first 12 days of the month only, and stored values that you can't even tell if they are correct or if days and months were swapped on input; in short, *a world of pain*, avoid these formats for data interchange.
